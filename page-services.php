                    <p class="text-primary">When planning district court litigation, opportunities for appeal should not be an afterthought. We assist clients in identifying scenarios in which they (or their opposing counsel) might try to take an early appeal.</p>

                    <p class="text-primary">Great arguments on appeal are essentially useless if you did not preserve the issue in the district court. We assist clients by ensuring that issues are preserved for potential review. By strategically planning and preserving appellate issues early in the litigation process, we make sure that our clients are well-positioned for success on appeal.</p>

From the start of litigation, we assist clients in identifying scenarios in which they (or their opposing counsel) might try to take an early appeal. We carefully evaluate each possibility to determine the likelihood of success on appeal and advise clients on the best course of action to achieve their objectives.</p>

                    <p class="text-primary">When appropriate, we assist clients in seeking dismissal of appeals on jurisdictional or procedural grounds. We help craft persuasive motions to dismiss that effectively address the legal issues presented in the appeal. And when our clients are on the other end of these motions, we help craft persuasive responses showing why the case belongs in the court of appeals.</p>

                    <p class="text-primary">Courts of appeals sometimes ask parties to address jurisdictional issues. Whether these briefing notices come before or after oral argument, we ensure the best possible presentation of our clients' position on the issues the court has identified.</p>
